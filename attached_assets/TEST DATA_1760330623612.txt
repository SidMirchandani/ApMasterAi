explanation
"B Keynesian economists believe that investment demand is relatively inelastic, and thus unresponsive to changes in interest rates. They believe the economy is inherently unstable, that inadequate demand is largely to blame for periods of stagnation, and that real GDP needs a boost to reach the full-employment level. They also believe that the money supply has little effect on interest rates due to a relatively flat money demand curve, and that changes in interest rates have little effect on investment due to a relatively inelastic investment demand curve. For these reasons they see little use for monetary policy and prefer fiscal policy instead."

explanation
"B The total amount that the government owes at a given time has to do with the national debt, not the balance of the budget. Exports compared with imports have to do with the trade surplus or deficit. Whether a budget deficit exists is based on the difference between government spending and tax collections for a given period (usually a year). If the government spends more than it collects in taxes, there is a deficit. If it spends less than it collects in taxes, there is a surplus. If it spends the same amount that it collects, then the budget is said to be "balanced.""
