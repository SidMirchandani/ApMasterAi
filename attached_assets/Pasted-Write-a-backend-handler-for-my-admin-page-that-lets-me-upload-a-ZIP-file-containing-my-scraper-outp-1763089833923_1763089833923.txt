Write a backend handler for my admin page that lets me upload a ZIP file
containing my scraper output.

The ZIP will ALWAYS contain this folder structure:

export/
 ├── questions/
 │     ├── 1.json
 │     ├── 2.json
 │     ├── ...
 └── images/
       ├── 1/
       │     ├── question_1.png
       │     ├── A_1.png
       │     └── ...
       ├── 2/
       └── ...

Your task:

1. Create an API route or handler `/admin/import-questions` that:
   - Accepts a ZIP file upload (`multipart/form-data`)
   - Saves the ZIP temporarily
   - Extracts it into a temp directory `./tmp_import/`

2. After extracting:
   - Read every JSON file in `./tmp_import/export/questions/`
   - For each question file, parse:
       subject_code
       section_code
       question_id
       prompt
       choices (object A–E)
       correct_answer
       explanation
       local_images (arrays: question, A, B, C, D, E)

3. For images found in:
       ./tmp_import/export/images/<qid>/
   upload each file to Firebase Storage path:
       questions/<qid>/<filename>

   Then replace each entry in local_images with the Firebase download URL.

4. Build the Firestore document using THIS schema:

   Collection: `questions`
   Document ID: `${subject_code}_${section_code}_Q${question_id}`

   Fields:
     subject_code: string
     section_code: string
     question_id: number
     prompt: string
     choices: array [A,B,C,D,E] (empty string if missing)
     answerIndex: 0–4
     explanation: string
     image_urls:
        {
          question: array of URLs,
          A: array of URLs,
          B: array of URLs,
          C: array of URLs,
          D: array of URLs,
          E: array of URLs
        }
     mode: "SECTION"
     test_slug: ""
     tags: []
     createdAt: server timestamp
     updatedAt: server timestamp
     rand: random float 0–1

5. Insert or update each Firestore doc.

6. After processing:
   - delete the temp extracted folder
   - delete the uploaded zip

7. Return a JSON response listing:
   - how many questions imported
   - Firestore doc IDs
   - number of images uploaded

Use Node.js with:

- express (for the upload endpoint)
- multer (for multipart file upload)
- adm-zip or unzipper (for extraction)
- firebase-admin SDK
- fs/promises

Finally:
Produce a full working file named `import_questions.js` that I can run from my Replit backend,
and also produce the corresponding Express route handler code.

Begin now.
