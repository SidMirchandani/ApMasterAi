📘 AP Practice App Project Kickoff Document
Project Title: APMaster.ai (working name — subject to change)
Target Launch: May 2026 (soft beta release by Jan 2026)

🌟 Project Vision
Our mission is to build an intuitive, AI-powered AP test prep platform that empowers students across the U.S. to prepare more efficiently for their AP exams. The tool will combine the structure of College Board practice, the community feel of Fiveable, and the intelligence of ChatGPT, making test prep personalized, engaging, and effective.

We’re not just creating a study tool — we’re building a smart learning environment that:

Mimics the real AP test experience (timed sections, scoring, instant feedback).

Gives AI-powered explanations and recommendations.

Tracks student progress and helps them focus on weak areas.

Is free and accessible to all.

🎯 End Goal
By the end of this project, we will:

Launch a fully functional web-based app for AP students with:

Timed practice tests for multiple AP subjects.

Realistic scoring and automated explanations.

Personalized reports and AI tutoring.

Host and test with at least 500+ users by Spring 2026.

Share our platform on social media, at schools, and AP communities.

Possibly open-source parts of our code for educational impact and recognition.

🛠 Tools & Technologies
We’ve carefully chosen tools that are beginner-friendly, scalable, and cost-effective.
