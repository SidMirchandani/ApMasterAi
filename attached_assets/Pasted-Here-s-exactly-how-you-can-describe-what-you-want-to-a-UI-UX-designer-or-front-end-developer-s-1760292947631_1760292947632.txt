Here’s exactly how you can describe what you want to a **UI/UX designer** (or front-end developer) so they understand your intent clearly — concise but professional phrasing you can send directly:

---

### 🧾 **Instruction Brief**

> **Goal:**
> Modernize the existing **APMaster UI** (AP Macroeconomics course page) to make it visually premium and production-ready **without changing the layout or color theme**.

---

### 🎨 **Visual Style Direction**

> * Keep **the same layout, spacing, colors, and typography**.
> * Apply **subtle visual polish** for a more professional, high-end feel:
>
>   * Add **soft depth and elevation** to cards and buttons (shadow + slight blur).
>   * Use **smooth glassy highlights** or **semi-transparent overlays** to create a modern, “real” surface feel.
>   * Maintain the current **green (#16a34a)**, **blue (#3b82f6)**, and **orange** accents — **do not recolor**.
>   * Refine borders: thin (1px) with light gradient or faint outline.
>   * Apply **rounded corners (10–12px)** consistently across cards and buttons.
>   * Use a **soft neutral background (#f9fafb or light gray)** with minimal contrast shifts.
>   * Make hover/active states gently animated (0.2–0.3s ease-in-out).

### 🧠 **UI Functionality**

> * Keep all component positions identical — no layout restructuring.
> * Maintain identical text and button hierarchy.
> * Ensure it’s fully **responsive** (works cleanly on iPad and laptop).
> * Use consistent **font weights** (e.g., 700 for headings, 500 for body text).
> * All buttons should have **consistent height and alignment**.
> * Add **smooth micro-interactions** (button lift, progress fill animation, hover glow).

---

### ✨ **Output Expectation**

> * Deliver a Figma (or coded) redesign that looks **polished, glassy, and premium** but still **feels identical to the current version** in structure.
> * Visual goal: *“Looks like it could have been designed by Apple or Google Education.”*

Would you like me to write a **one-paragraph designer brief** (for posting on Discord/Figma/Upwork) that summarizes all this in a natural, professional way?
