**"Do NOT rewrite whole files or change any business logic.
Only adjust layout, spacing, image behavior, and density.
Do NOT touch any correct/wrong color logic.
Do NOT alter state, API logic, or component structure.

Apply the following updates exactly:

================================================================

1. IMAGE LOGIC (APPLY TO BOTH QUESTION STEM + ANSWER CHOICES)

Use the same floating-hover image behavior everywhere an image appears.

WRAPPER:

<div class="relative inline-block group max-w-[240px]">


THUMBNAIL IMAGE:

<img class="w-full h-auto object-contain rounded-md shadow cursor-pointer" />


HOVER FULL PREVIEW (FLOATING ABOVE, NOT CLIPPED):

<div class="absolute left-0 top-0 z-50 hidden group-hover:block">
  <img src="SAME_SRC" class="max-w-[600px] max-h-[600px] object-contain rounded-md shadow-xl bg-white p-2" />
</div>


FOR ANSWER CHOICES, reduce the default thumbnail width to half:

max-w-[120px]


Everything else (hover preview, wrapper, full-size behavior) stays the same.

================================================================

2. QUESTION HEADER + PROMPT HEIGHT MATCHING ANSWER CHOICE HEIGHT

Make the question number box, the mark for review section, and the question prompt container have the same minimum height as the answer choice card height.

Use:

min-h-[140px]
flex flex-col justify-center


(Adjust height only using Tailwind; do not change layout structure.)

This should ensure:

The question prompt aligns visually with choices

The top section isn’t too thin

================================================================

3. MAKE THE DENSITY/THICKNESS MATCH ACROSS ALL MODES

Apply the same vertical spacing, padding, and compact density to:

Review pages

Unit-wise practice

Full-length practice

Any question rendering pages

Rules:

Choice cards use p-4, font size text-base, gap space-y-2

Question container uses consistent padding (p-6 max)

Do NOT modify correct/wrong color logic

Do NOT change any success/error tailwind classes

Only unify layout density

================================================================

4. DO NOT CHANGE

Correct/wrong color logic

API calls

Navigation logic

Card selection logic

State management

Any component besides layout, spacing, and image wrappers

Only implement the above styling changes."**
